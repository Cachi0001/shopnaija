[Completed Change - 2024-05-30]

- Added a robust ErrorBoundary component in src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx to catch and display errors gracefully in the dashboard.
- Wrapped the main dashboard return block in src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx with ErrorBoundary to ensure UI errors are caught and shown to the user.
- Added console.error logging in ErrorBoundary for better error traceability.
- FIX: Added a default export to src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx to resolve Vercel build error caused by import/export mismatch (so it can be imported as 'import ErrorBoundary from ...').
- ENHANCEMENT: ErrorBoundary now logs the current route (window.location.pathname) and user object (from window or localStorage) when an error is caught, to help debug production errors.
- ENHANCEMENT: ErrorBoundary now logs window.location, window.location.hash, process.env.NODE_ENV, props, and attaches global error handlers for uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections.
- ENHANCEMENT: Added console logging and try/catch in App.tsx to log which route and main component is being rendered, to help debug the root error on '/'.

[Planned Change - YYYY-MM-DD]

- Add a robust ErrorBoundary component to the main dashboard area (AdminDashboard.tsx) to catch and display errors gracefully.
- Add extra logging to catch and log errors with more context in the dashboard and data-fetching logic.
- Commit and push these changes to the GitHub repository.
